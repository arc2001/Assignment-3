        <h1 >Success</h1>
    <p >There are many ways in the world to be successful. But most people think of celebrities, artist, politicians, and businessmen whenever they heard the word success.

        Moreover, they think doing what they will make you successful but that not the case. They forget the most basic thing that makes a person successful that is their hard work, dedication, and the desire to achieve their dream. More importantly, they what they like to do not what that others told them to do. Successful people do what they like to do also they do what they feel correct for their business. If you look in the dictionary for the meaning of the word success then you will find that it means the achievement of one's goal or aim. So, basically, anyone can achieve success by simply achieving their aim or goal.</p>
        <h1 >Failure</h1>
        <p >
            Failure does not lie in losing a game but in losing oneâ€™s heart. Those who lose heart and stop trying further remain defeated in life. The pleasure of success after experiencing failure is invigorating. Therefore failures should not be looked upon as enemies but friends of men.
            This proverb means that failures lead us to success. Failures should not discourage us. We should not lose heart in case we fail to achieve our objective. Failures have their own uses. They make us conscious of our weaknesses. They give us an opportunity to remove them. We try to find out the reasons for our failures and then make efforts to set them right. Failures make a man wiser. He learns a lesson not to repeat old mistakes in the future. No doubt failures are frightening. But there hardly anybody who has not tasted failure in life.
